# Target Blitz - Game Interaction Design

## Core Game Concept
A fast-paced reaction game where players click colorful moving targets that appear and disappear across the screen. The game gets progressively harder as time goes on, with targets moving faster, appearing for shorter durations, and becoming smaller.

## Game Mechanics

### Main Game Loop
- **Game Duration**: 60 seconds per round
- **Target Spawning**: Targets appear at random positions every 1-3 seconds (interval decreases as difficulty increases)
- **Target Lifetime**: Targets disappear after 2-4 seconds if not clicked (duration decreases with difficulty)
- **Target Movement**: Targets move in random directions with increasing speed
- **Scoring**: 
  - Base points: 10 points per target
  - Combo multiplier: +1 for each consecutive hit (max 5x)
  - Speed bonus: +5 points for hitting targets within 0.5 seconds
  - Accuracy bonus: +10 points for 90%+ accuracy

### Difficulty Progression
- **Level 1-15**: Target size decreases from 80px to 40px
- **Level 1-15**: Target speed increases by 20% each level
- **Level 1-15**: Spawn interval decreases from 2.5s to 1s
- **Level 1-15**: Target lifetime decreases from 3s to 1.5s

### Target Types
- **Standard Targets**: Blue circles worth 10 points

- **Bomb Targets**: Red X marks that deduct 20 points if clicked
